        <p>My name is Hunter Clark, I am a data engineer with five years of experience building and optimizing data pipelines, specializing in feature engineering for data science models. I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at the University of Idaho, where I focus on machine learning and data-driven solutions. I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Boise State University.

            Before transitioning to data engineering, I served in the U.S. Navy as a rescue swimmer and tactical helicopter aircrewman, where I developed the problem-solving skills and attention to detail that now guide my approach to complex data challenges. My expertise spans cloud-based data architectures, large-scale ETL processing, and data modeling. I have worked extensively with AWS resources and Pyspark to build scalable, high-performance data solutions. Additionally, I have experience designing and implementing feature stores, managing structured and unstructured datasets, and optimizing query performance for analytics and machine learning applications. My work also includes schema design, SQL-based data transformations, and data governance strategies to ensure consistency and efficiency in data processing workflows. I have presented research at international conferences, including IEEE TALE.
            
            I am passionate about leveraging data to drive meaningful insights and improve decision-making. Outside of my studies and work, I enjoy playing soccer, staying active, and spending time with my pets and family.</p>
